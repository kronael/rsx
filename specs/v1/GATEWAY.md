# Gateway Service

Gateway adapts external clients to internal CMP. It owns
sessions, auth, rate limits, and ingress backpressure. The
wire protocol is defined in WEBPROTO.md.

## Responsibilities

- WebSocket ingress/egress (public + native)
- Auth and session tracking
- Rate limiting and overload rejection
- Basic field validation
- CMP/UDP forwarding to Risk and responses back to clients

## Protocol

- WebSocket frame formats: WEBPROTO.md
- Error codes and reject reasons: MESSAGES.md

## Backpressure

- If internal queues exceed limits, reject new orders with
  an OVERLOADED error.
- Gateway does not block on internal congestion.

## Config

- Env-only. See rsx-gateway config module.

## Notes

Gateway contains no risk logic and no matching logic. It is
purely an adaptation layer between external clients and
internal CMP links.
